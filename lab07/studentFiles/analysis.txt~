Analysis

For the prelab there were two parts. The first part was a a macro that takes
in value to stop the macro. In the lab07a.c, 3 was the number passed into the 
macro. What the macro does, is it starts at 0 cubes that number and adds it
to the sum of 0, and 0 cubed is zero. Then it does the same with 1, 1 cubed is
1. Now the sum is 1. Then 2 is cubed, 2 cube is 8 which is now added to the
sum of 1. Now the sum is 9. 0,1,9 were the numbers that were printed out. 

The second part of the prelab was demonstartion of the 2-d array and how to
access them. The file lab07b.c initializes a 2-d array with 15 random
integers in it. Then after the initialization, different indexing methods are
tested.

In the interactive exercises, the macro example 2 didn't build  because there
needed an opening and closing brackets at the beginning and end of the macro 
and the last print statement of the macro need a semicolon. It printed out 5 
and 10 onto the console. This wasn't the solution that this program originally
needed, but since I changed the scope of the macro where if begins at the 
opening the brackets and the end of brackets.
