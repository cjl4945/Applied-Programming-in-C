MACRO Example 2:
the print statement in the macro needed to have a semicolon on the end of 
the statement

var1 in f2: 5
var1 in f1: 10

MACRO Example 3:
The n in the macro need to be in parenthesises itself becuase it seems
that the program took premdas into consideration. It seemed to multiply 5 and
5 together first instead of of add the 5 and 5 first.

MULTIPLY: 50

MACRO Example 4:

I think the output will result in x = -5 and abs = 4

RESULT: 4
X IS: -3

The macro has two instructions inside of it. So when -5 gets passed it, it 
turns abs into 4 and x not equals -4, then on the return x is then increased 
again to change x to -3

DYNAMIC 2d Array Example:

 
The code malloc space for each row, them calloc space for each column.
Then it begins populating the 2d array with random integers from 0-99.
Then prints out the each element at each index of the 2d array. 

It doesn't seem to have any issues with the program. 

There is 144 bytes of memory that have been leaked


No, free(A) won't do the trick because you must free all the space allocated 
for the columns.
