1. The fucntion must be continuous and A and B, the upper and lower endpoints
of the interval must bracket the root.

2. When the the root has an odd multiplicity 

3. No, is most likely never zero, but arbitrarily close.

4. Halve the size of the bracketing interval enclosing the root. Choose a 
smaller bracket that includes the roor. Repeat until bracket size is small 
enough. You can stop making you bracket smaller once opposite signs are at the
bracket endpoints and find the root. 

5. You produce a upper half of interval that brackets a root with midpoint as
lower endpoint.

6. The newton and secant both use derivatives to approximate the root. 

7. An escape hatch is prevent infinite loops.

8. The Newton method requires a closed form expression for the derivative.

9. newton = xn - (f(xn)/f'(xn));secant =xn-f(xn)((xn-xn-1)/(f(xn) - f(xn-1)))

10. The 2nd guess does not have to bracket the root, it is just used to 
calculate the slope.  Typically, the 2nd guess is + 0.001* of the first guess.

11. enough.  The Newton method uses the local slope of the function and the 
intersection of that slope with the X axis to create an improved guess.  
Newton follows the slope down to the root.

12.fabs is used for floating type data and abs returns the absolute value. 
fabs is going to be more accurate than abs since it uses decimal places.

13. The derivative of the slope can't be zero or very small, so it checks
both cases.
