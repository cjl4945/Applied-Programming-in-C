Assingment:

So I tried to rework where I put my timing macros becuase it seemed that every
time the macro iterated, it would print the results of the roots. So to 
actually get results from the timing macro, there needed to be a lot of 
iterations. I used 50000, and 50000 roots were also printed out so ran each 
optimization level by head with each permance time at the bottom of the 50000 
roots. I did put the the results in the results.txt file, there it can be 
shown how many time the roots were printed. But i individually collected the 
performances times and average them out by my self. And the following 
performances times for each level are as followed. 

Level -O1:
Time elapsed (timer) = 0.340000 sec.
Avg Elapsed CPU Time Over 50000 iterations (timer) = 6.6e-06 sec.

Level -O2:
Time elapsed (timer) = 0.340000 sec.
Avg Elapsed CPU Time Over 50000 iterations (timer) = 6.8e-06 sec.

Level -O3:
Time elapsed (timer) = 0.350000 sec.
Avg Elapsed CPU Time Over 50000 iterations (timer) = 7e-06 sec.

By these performances, I decided to choose the optimization level -O1. 
It seemed the program took more time when imaginary numbers were involved.
But -O1 still seemed to be the best option.
