1. The difference in the allocation and deacllocation approaches allocated 
memory for each row, and inside each row memory was also allocated for each 
each column. Then to deallocate memory, we went through each column in each 
row and deallocated the memory, the deallocated the rows. 

Example 1:

Operation 15^2/3 repeated 10000000 times
** CLOCKS_PER_SEC  is 1000000 ticks/sec
** Size of clock_t is 8 bytes
   Total Time = 60000 "clocks ticks"
   Total Time = 0.060000 [sec]
   Time per Iteration=6e-09 [sec]

Clocks per second was 1000000.
The time in clock ticks = 600000
The time in seconds = 0.06

Timing Example 2:


Operation 75=15^2/3 repeated 1 times
** CLOCKS_PER_SEC  is 1000000 ticks/sec

2.

Operation 75=15^2/3 repeated 10000000 times
** CLOCKS_PER_SEC  is 1000000 ticks/sec
** Size of clock_t is 8 bytes
   Total Time = 50000 "clocks ticks"
   Total Time = 0.050000 [sec]
   Time per Iteration=5e-09 [sec]


Timing measurement with GNU Linux time:


Operation 75=15^2/3 repeated 10000000 times
** CLOCKS_PER_SEC  is 1000000 ticks/sec
** Size of clock_t is 8 bytes
   Total Time = 60000 "clocks ticks"
   Total Time = 0.060000 [sec]
   Time per Iteration=6e-09 [sec]
real 0.06
user 0.06
sys 0.00
