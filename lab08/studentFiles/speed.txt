Analysis:
The higher the optimazation, level the faster the program runs 
as showed with the average time elapsed results. The iterations 
time and total elapsed time for the data decreased as the 
optimazation levels increase. The total elapsed time for the 
calculation portion generally decreased, but remained the same for the
the -O1 and -O2 optimazation. And the same for the iterations, with 
the -O1 and -O2 optimazation levels staying the same. The final concensus
is that the higher optimazation levels results in faster program speeds.
