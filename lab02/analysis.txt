1.)	Command: (-a -c asdf)
	getopt() returned ='a'
	getopt() returned ='c'
	aflag = 1, bflag = 0, cvalue = asdf

a sets the aflag. c prompts for another argument that would be taken as the cvalue and the cvalue is
asdf

2.)	Command: (-a -c)
	getopt() returned ='a'
	getopt() returned ='?'

similar to step one, but a cvalue wasn't inputted so getopt returned ? to handle the error

3.)	Command: (-a -c asdf qwer)
	getopt() returned ='a'
	getopt() returned ='c'
	aflag = 1, bflag = 0, cvalue = asdf
	Non-option argument qwer

similar to step 1 but a non option argument was added and it was accounted for. c's required parameter
was satisfied

4.)	The ":" after the c means the -c has a required argument

5.)	If ":" changes to "::" then the -c would have an optional argument

6. 
	Command: (-a -c asdf)
	getopt() returned ='a'
	getopt() returned ='c'
	aflag = 1, bflag = 0, cvalue = (null)
	Non-option argument asdf

here we used abc::vwhich means the c has  a optional argument but a argument was passed and handled 
	
	Command: (-a -c)
	getopt() returned ='a'
	getopt() returned ='c'
	aflag = 1, bflag = 0, cvalue = (null)
there's no problem here because c has an optional argument and nothing was pass into it
	
	Command: (-a -c asdf qwer)
	getopt() returned ='a'
	getopt() returned ='c'
	aflag = 1, bflag = 0, cvalue = (null)
	Non-option argument asdf
	Non-option argument qwer

two optional arguments were passed in and handled.
